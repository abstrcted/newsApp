# The Polarization Engine
## Automating the Echo Chamber

A satirical application that explores algorithmic bias, "rage farming," and the mechanics of modern digital polarization.

## Overview

The **Polarization Engine** is a demonstration of how innocent user data—facial features, engagement patterns, and demographics—can be used to construct a radicalized echo chamber. By utilizing a custom "PolarizationEncoder" and a "Reality Slider," the app filters news feeds to maximize emotional engagement (and outrage) rather than accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Stereotyping Engine (Face Scanner)**: Utilizes `DeepFace` to analyze your webcam feed, detecting age, emotion, and gender to assign you a "profile" and a corresponding political bias.
- **Reality Slider**: A control interface that lets you adjust the intensity of the echo chamber, shifting from "Objective Reality" to "Hyper-Polarized."
- **Rage Score Algorithm**: A custom metric (`Likelihood to Click * Controversy`) that ranks news articles based on their potential to trigger an emotional response.
- **Satire Chat**: An integrated AI chatbot that adopts a radicalized persona to reinforce your assigned bias.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **State Management**: React Context / Hooks
- **Components**: Custom UI components including the Reality Slider and Surveillance-style Face Scanner.

### Backend & ML
- **Server**: FastAPI
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - **PyTorch**: Custom `PolarizationEncoder` model.
  - **Transformers (HuggingFace)**: BERT backbone for semantic text analysis.
  - **DeepFace**: For facial profiling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+

### 1. Setup the Backend
The backend powers the ML models and news aggregation.

```bash
cd ../backend
python -m venv venv
# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
*Note: Ensure you have your OpenAI API key set in a `.env` file if you plan to use the Satire Chat.*

### 2. Setup the Frontend
Run the Next.js development server.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to experience the engine.

## Disclaimer

This project is a **satirical art piece** and educational tool designed to highlight the dangers of algorithmic bias. The "biases" and "stereotypes" generated by the engine are intentional exaggerations for demonstration purposes.
